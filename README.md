Name of Project: 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console.

Description: The AirBnB console is a mini-shell that can be used in both interactive and 
	     non-interactive modes. It is a basic clone of the AirBnB platform.

		command interpreter or console:
		The initial task is to work with a robust storage system that provides a 
		separation between the objects and the manner in which they are stored and 
		maintained. This translates to the fact that both your console code 
		(the command interpreter itself) and the future front-end and REST API will 
		not have to worry about the storage mechanism of these objects.


Launching the interpreter:
	
		
		To launch the console, you need to run the following command: ./console.py
	
	Usage:
		This console/command-interpreter allows you to manage objects (create, update,
		destroy, etc.) and store and persist these objects to a JSON file.
